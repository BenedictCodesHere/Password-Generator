The user can specify password length (between 10 and 64 characters inclusive), and whether they wish to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters. The user must select at least one of these types. 
The user can click the "Generate" button. On clicking, the user's newly generated password is displayed in the centre of the text box.
